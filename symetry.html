</head>
<article>
<p>What Wes Anderson definitely loves is o compose his shots with perfect symmetry. From his breakout hit <em>Rushmore</em>, to his stop-motion animated movie <em>The Fantastic Mr. Fox</em>, to his most recent movies <em>The Grand Budapest Hotel</em> and <em>Isle f Dogs</em>, Anderson consistently organizes the elements in his frame so that the most important thing is smack in the middle.</p>
<p>Symmetry is inherently pleasing to the eye (studies have shown a baby’s gaze will tend towards whomever’s face is most symmetrical in a room), but it’s also traditionally taboo for film directors as it can feel staged and unnatural. Anderson, though, embraces the theatrical aesthetic and always seeks to place his key character or prop directly before his audience, either at eye level or, per his other signature shot, from directly above.</p>
